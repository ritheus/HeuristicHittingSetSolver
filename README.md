# Hittingset

**Hittingset** is a command-line tool offering several **heuristic algorithms to solve the Minimum Hitting Set Problem**.  
It is highly configurable via command-line parameters and intended for research, benchmarking, or educational purposes.

---

## Features

- Multiple algorithms: Greedy, Adaptive Greedy, VC, (a very bad) Branch-and-Reduce
- Advanced local search options
- Kernelization rules (reduction rules) for problem simplification
- Configurable neighborhood strategies for local search

---

## Requirements

### General

- C++17-compatible compiler
- [GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
  - Must be installed and available via `<glpk.h>`

### Windows (Visual Studio 2022)

- Developed and tested under **Visual Studio 2022** with C++17
- GLPK integrated locally (e.g., via NuGet package or manual linking)

### Linux

Install GLPK via:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglpk-dev
```

Build project via:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

---

## Recommended Usage Examples

Basic greedy run:

```bash
./hittingset -a greedy -i BigExample.hgr
```

Greedy with explorative local search (uniform random destruction + greedy repair) and flat neighborhood:

```bash
./hittingset -a greedy -i BigExample.hgr --kernelization_unitEdgeRule --localSearch_random --localSearch_numIterations 100000 --localSearch_numDeletions 5 --neighborhood_flat
```

VC-based algorithm with explorative LP-based local search (LP-weighted random destruction + greedy repair) and shrinking neighborhood. This is particularly useful if you already have an LP solution, but the code needs to be tweaked in this case:

```bash
./hittingset -a VC -i SmallExample.hgr --kernelization_allRules --localSearch_LP --localSearch_numIterations 100000 --localSearch_numDeletions 100 --neighborhood_shrinking --neighborhood_minDeletions 5 --neighborhood_stepInterval 800
```
